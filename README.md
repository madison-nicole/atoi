# atoi
The C library function atoi() converts the string argument to an integer value. 
To deepen my understanding of recursive functions in C, I implemented two functions that perform this conversion. 
Writing commonly-used library functions and using low-level programming deepens our understanding of the code we write, making this good practice.

## Specifications
- *atoi-iterative.c* implements the function using loops
- *atoi-recursive.c* implements the same function using recursion

## Usage
First, download the [CS50 library](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50/releases) and follow these [instructions](https://github.com/madison-nicole/libcs50). The code must then be compiled.
Run "./atoi-iterative" or "./atoi-recursive," respectively, in the command-line to run each program.
